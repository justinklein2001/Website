# Website
Author: Justin Klein
Date: January 16th, 2021
Release: v1.0

Code for my personal website. 1.0 focuses on being fully responsive. With future iterations I plan to add major php functionality for a contact form and other projects based in PHP and JavaScript. I would love to post all my school projects to this site but it would be considered academic misconduct. So, on top of all my school projects I've been finding time to teach myself PHP and trying to think up clever projects. More to come soon.

Known Bugs in 1.0:
  -html tel: is not working for some reason, takes me to a 404 page; requires more research
  -cPanel hosting doesn't like my PHP files, currently trying to fix that now. 
  -Some photos dissapear on only certain mobile aspect ratios (specifically my Pixel 4)
