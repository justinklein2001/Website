            <p class="about-paragraph">A Generalist to my core, I have my toes dipped in many ponds.
              My wide range of hobbies, interests and skills have developed me into a well-rounded
              individual. I am currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at the University of Guelph, with a minor in business. My academic studies enable me to stimulate the more analytical side of my mind, as computing requires a large amount of problem solving and technical skill, both of which I have ample of. I am knowledgeable of many popular Software Development Methodologies, including Agile Development and S.C.R.U.M. I am also extremely proficient in the C programming language, Java and have dabbled in web development to create this very site. </p>

            <p class="about-paragraph">When I’m not locked in on my computer coding my day away, I enjoy stimulating the more
               creative side of my brain. I adore playing the guitar and have been writing my own music
               for the last 5 years. I am also currently in the process of teaching myself how to produce
               and mix my own music so that I can share my creations with the world. Paired greatly with writing my own music, I also write poetry whenever I feel blue. I'm a writer at heart, I always use words to convey how I see the world and how it makes me feel. Thus, between being a formidable Software Developer and a great communicator, I would be an asset to any team.</p>

        <p>I am currently in the process of producing my own solo EP and am working on a collaborative EP in a duo, 
        both of which are expected to be released by Q2 2021. My solo project dabbles in my french background, as most of my own songs are
        written and sung in French. The guitar is my muse and my connection to all that is groovy. My words just lift it into being. 
        My collaborative project focuses more on modern RnB, with me playing lead guitar and acting as a co-writer. I eagerly await the day I am 
        able to post my first single release on this page. </p>

          <p>The audio clip at the epicenter of this modest little section of my site lives a rough demo of my most complete collaborative song with my 
          bandmate Nathan. It features me playing lead guitar and Nathan takes on lead vocals. We both share a love for Spider-Man, so we decided to write 
          a song that would most embody the sentiments that his primary love interest, Mary Jane, must face daily. We are currently working very hard to 
          complete this song alongside a handful of others for our first EP release. The album cover is temporary, but I always take any opportunity I 
          can to show off my dog!</p>

          <h3 class="poem-title">A Simple Breeze</h3>
          <p class="poem">
            Senses confuse the soul.<br>
            One minute you're strutting along the everso boring route to your bedroom,<br>
            in an attempt to catch 8 hours of solid heavenly rest,<br>
            When oh what's that?<br>
            A breeze. A window left open, to mature.<br>
            It changes the whole aroma of the room.<br>
            She smells cold, if that could be believed.<br>
            In an instant, your neurons reignite your heart.<br>
            You're no longer in your sweet humble abode.<br>
            You're 17, camping in the middle of who knows where?<br>
            And it's cold. Damn cold.<br>
            You're snuggling on to your then girlfriend just to strip her of any heat she may not know she needs.<br>
            A sweet memory. A memory that overthrew your mind in an instant.<br>
            All it took was a simple breeze, and all you wanted to do was to drift into unconscious being.<br>

          <h3 class="poem-title">Fighting My Bed</h3>
          <p class="poem">
            The mornings are when I must endure the most.<br>
            It's in those first few moments where reality has won its wager against my subconscious. Where my deepest<br>
            thoughts and desires cease to manifest themselves in my mind, to make way for something tangible.<br>
            Still, their imprints linger.<br>
            A manipulated recollection, changed ever so perfectly as to entice the mind to desire it once more.<br>
            They are lies, half-truths. <br>
            All these dreams paint a world that you never truly inhabit, but wish you could.<br>
            Do not treat them as fact, as reminiscing about a myth is a fool's errand, and you are no fool.<br>
            Be better, be in the now, be you.<br>
            Get up.<br>

          <h3 class="poem-title">A Candle in the Graveyard</h3>
          <p class="poem">
            I've lived next to a graveyard for years now,<br/>
            The dead make good neighbours.<br/>
            Their stones, daily reminders that my time is limited.<br/>
            I do not have an eternity to become the man I want to be.<br/>
            My choices today affect how I am remembered tomorrow.<br/>
            Some of these corpses died,<br/>
            Angry, arrogant, alone.<br/>
            I see this when I throw a look their way,<br/>
            And glimpse only a single ember, blazing the night sky.<br/>
            One person, in a sea of tombs, has their long dormant face, lit.<br/>
            The others remain stiff, cold.<br/>
            This person, even in death, finds a way to lighten the void they find themselves in.<br/>
            If they can do it after they've died,<br/>
            How can I say I’m alive?

          <p class="poem">
            If you don't know me well,<br/>
            My aura may reflect that of a frostbitten snowman.<br/>
            Ice cold, down to my button nose.<br/>
            But if you are apart of the chosen few,<br/>
            Who have chiseled me down to my wet, mushy core.<br/>
            Then I thank you.<br/>
            You have given me hope that good people still roam.<br/>
            Roam these parts I once thought to be barren of empathy.<br/>
            I am grateful you saw me, in my frigid state, <br/>
            And decided to thaw away my bitter cold.<br/>
            Because now I stand, free in the sun.<br/>
            Slowly melting away into the earth.<br/>
            Fading away, happy.<br/>

          <h3 class="poem-title">Flickering Flame</h3>
          <p class="poem">
            Our Love is the flickering flame of a dying candle,<br>
            The sensation of pleasantness and the auroma of bliss.<br>
            Yet, no embers spark when we kiss?<br>
            Just the ahses of a once blazing romance.<br>
            That fickle clinging love that just cannot end.<br>
            But it should end. <br>
            It needs to end.<br>
            For if this ember vows to never turn cold,<br>
            Yet remains its dormant self,<br>
            I'll never feel that blast of heat from the flame of another.<br>
            A flame that can run hotter than our modest little flicker.<br>
            It's time we blow it out forever.<br>
